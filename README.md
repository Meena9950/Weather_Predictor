# Weather_Predictor

In this project, we will predict tomorrow's temperature using historical weather data. We'll begin by downloading a local weather dataset, which can be customized for different locations. The data will be cleaned and prepared for machine learning, followed by building a model for historical temperature predictions. We'll enhance the model by incorporating additional predictors and conclude by demonstrating how to make next-day temperature predictions.
